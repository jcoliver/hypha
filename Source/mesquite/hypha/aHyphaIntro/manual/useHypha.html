		<h3>Using Hypha to display support values from multiple trees</h3>
		<h4>A. Setting up the Mesquite file</h4>
		<p>To use Hypha, you will need a Mesquite file with a Taxa block with all taxa from all trees you are considering.  
		For information in setting up a Mesquite file, refer to the Mesquite Manual’s sections on files.  You can find 
		basic file information in Mesquite (<span class="menuCommand">Help &gt; Mesquite Manual, Basics: Files</span>) or 
		in the online manual:</p>
		<font size="-1">
			<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/managingFiles.html">http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/managingFiles.html</a></p>
		</font>
		<p>For information on taxa, see (<span class="menuCommand">Help &gt; Mesquite Manual, Objects: Taxa</span>) in Mesquite 
		or go to the online manual at:</p>
		<font size="-1">
			<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/Taxa.html">http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/Taxa.html</a></p>
		</font>
		<p>The names of the taxa in the Taxa block must match the taxon names in the trees files exactly for tree importation 
		to occur smoothly.  The file should also include the phylogenetic tree on which you would like to draw the support 
		value grids, hereafter referred to as the display tree.  The easiest way to accomplish this would be to open a nexus 
		file from within mesquite, consisting of (a) a TAXA or DATA block containing all the taxa and (b) a TREES block 
		containing the display tree.</p>
		<p>Next, include the trees from which support values will be harvested (support value trees).  To do this, select 
		<span class="menuCommand">Taxa & Trees &gt; Get File with Trees &gt; Include Contents...</span>  and select the tree 
		file(s) you would like to include.  If you have multiple taxa blocks, you may be asked to instruct Mesquite which 
		taxa block the trees correspond to.  Additionally, if there are taxa in these tree files that are not included in 
		the Taxa block of the Mesquite file, users may encounter problems incorporating those support value trees into the 
		file.  Differences in spellings of taxon names may lead to problems, but Mesquite reports the taxon names that are 
		causing problems.  If there is a problem including a tree file, users should correct the tree file in question, so 
		taxon names match those in the Mesquite file.</p>
		<p>When all the support value trees have been included, and all these trees correspond to the same taxa block as 
		the phylogenetic tree, you are ready to set up the Grid Coordinator.  If you only have a single taxa block in your 
		file, then all included trees should refer to that taxa block.  However, if you’re not sure, you can check by opening 
		<span class="menuCommand">Taxa & Trees &gt; List of Tree Blocks</span> and looking at the ‘Taxa’ column.  The included 
		support value trees should all refer to the same Taxa block as the display tree you wish to use for support value 
		visualization.</p>

		<h4>B. Setting up the Grid Coordinator</h4>
		<p>Start by opening up the display tree in a tree window (<span class="menuCommand">Taxa & Trees &gt; New Tree Window 
		&gt; Stored Trees</span>).  Currently, Hypha is only set up to work on Square, right&#45;oriented trees, so make sure 
		the display tree is drawn in this manner (<span class="menuCommand">Display &gt; Tree Form &gt; Square Line Tree</span> and 
		<span class="menuCommand">Drawing &gt; Orientation &gt; Right</span>).  Begin the Grid Coordinator by selecting 
		<span class="menuCommand">Analysis:Tree &gt; Grids for nodes</span>.  You will be prompted to enter the 
		number of rows and number of columns.  This will dictate the number of support values shown for each node.  Currently, 
		all cells in the grid must correspond to some support value, and the maximum number of columns and rows is three (for 
		a total maximum of nine possible support values displayed in a three by three grid).  The number of cells in the grid 
		will likely correspond to the number of support value trees you have included in the file.</p>
		<p>Mesquite will then prompt you for the following information for each cell in the grid:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Number For Node of Tree</li>
			<li>Tree source</li>
			<li>Threshold value for cell</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The prompts will occur cell by cell.  In other words, you will be prompted for 1, 2, and 3 above for the first cell, 
		then prompted for 1, 2, and 3 for the second cell, then for the third cell, etc.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>For the first prompt (Number For Node of Tree), you will select either &quot;Branch Lengths for Node from 
			Other Tree&quot; or &quot;Branch Labels for Node from Other Tree&quot;.  Select the former if the support 
			value tree corresponding to that cell has support values stored as branch lengths (such as bootstrap scores 
			from PAUP), and select the latter if the support value tree corresponding to that cell has support values 
			stored as branch labels (such as posterior probabilities from MrBayes).  If you’re not sure how the support 
			values are stored, you can open a tree window for the support value tree in question (before you set up the 
			Grid Coordinator; you may cancel the grid coordinator setup and start over if necessary), via 
			<span class="menuCommand">Taxa & Trees > New Tree Window</span>.  Select <span class="menuCommand">Window 
			&gt View Mode &gt Text</span> tab and look at the newick format of the tree.  Trees with support values 
			stored as branch lengths will show support values immediately after a colon (:).  For example:

			<p style="text-align:center;">(((A, B):80, C):95)</p>

			Is a newick format tree, showing support value of 80 for an A + B clade, and a support value of 95 for an A + 
			B + C clade.  Trees with support values stored as branch labels will show support values immediately after a 
			clade (if the tree also has branch lengths stored, the support values will precede the colon).  The same tree 
			as above, with support values stored as branch labels will be represented as:

			<p style="text-align:center;">(((A, B)&nbsp;80, C)&nbsp;95)</p>

			If this tree also had branch lengths (showing, for example, the expected amount of evolutionary change), it 
			would be written as:

			<p style="text-align:center;">(((A, B)&nbsp;80:0.50, C)&nbsp;95:1.2)</p>

			Indicating an A + B clade with support value of 80 and a branch length of 0.50, and an A + B + C clade with 
			support value of 95 and a branch length of 1.2.</li>

			<li>The second prompt, the Tree Source (for “Branch Lengths for Node from Other Tree” or &quot;Branch Labels for 
			Node from Other Tree&quot;, depending on choice for previous prompt), refers to the support value trees 
			corresponding to the grid cell.  Choose &#39;Stored Trees&#39;; you will assign specific trees to specific cells 
			in a later step.</li>

			<li>The final prompt asks the user to enter a threshold value.  This is the value used to determine the cutoff 
			point at which different colors are displayed on the grid.  For example, if the threshold value entered was 70, 
			any branches with applicable support values equal to or greater than 70 would be filled with black, and any 
			branches with applicable support values below 70 would be filled with white (inapplicable values are colored 
			grey; these are the default colors - users can change the colors later.  See Step III, below).  The thresholds 
			for determining conflict are the same as the threshold for support.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><img style="float:right" src="images/Figure4.png" />After this information for each grid cell is provided, Mesquite 
		will draw grids on the display tree.  However, Mesquite, by default, is using the display tree for support values, so 
		you will have to change the tree source for each cell.  To do so, in the <a href="options.html#Legend">Grid 
		Coordinator Legend</a>,  click on a cell and select the support value tree you would like to correspond to that 
		particular cell (if the legend is not visible, it may be at the lower left corner of the tree drawing panel, but not 
		visible if the tree drawing is larger than the window; you can find the legend by using the tree window scroll bars).  
		If the desired support value tree is stored in the same Tree Block as the display tree, you should select &quot;Choose 
		tree...&quot; and choose the appropriate support value tree from the list.  If the support value tree is stored in a 
		different Tree Block (it will be if you followed the directions in the earlier part of these instructions, and have
		not edited the Tree Blocks), select &quot;Tree block (for Branch Lengths/Labels for Node from Other Tree)&quot;.  
		Mesquite will use the first tree in the tree block by default, so if the desired support value tree is not the first 
		tree, you will then need to use the &quot;Choose tree...&quot; option, as above.  After you have assigned support value 
		trees for all the cells in the grid, the cells should all be colored according to the threshold values, which are 
		displayed in the Grid Coordinator Legend.</p>
